## Notice

Starting with `2.2.0-preview.2`, UAI.LiteRTLM is also available on NuGet for .NET 6+! It supports all the same platforms as the Unity package, and works with MAUI.

Because the main package includes some Unity-specific workarounds, using the NuGet package requires a small amount of additional setup.
Before creating the `Engine`, call `Accelerators.LoadNativeLibraries()` to pre-load the native accelerator libraries.
You only need to call this method once; subsequent calls are no-ops.
